# Debugging of Multithreaded Programs

Multithreaded debugging is supported.

## Currently Debugged Thread

IKp3db identifies the currently debugged thread in `Ã¬s_debugged_thread`.
In VS Code GUI, the currently debugged thread is identified by his name starting 
with a star.

remains it until it is reset. 
For that you must click on the stop button of the IKpdnMainLoop thread is the threads list.
